We would like to remind our customers of our purchasing rules. Before leaving our shop, customers must test products to ensure satisfaction. We do not offer refunds for flavor preferences but will replace defective items such as those failing to charge or puff properly. Customers are accountable for the care and maintenance of their vape products, and any damage due to misuse will not be refunded. 

In addition to this, there will be no refund or replacement for online purchases outside Pampanga. 

For assistance or inquiries, please don't hesitate to contact our team.

**RESELLER PROGRAM POLICY**

Our supplier is where the stocks will come from. Their requirement is 50 pieces per order. If you're just starting, technically, we can include you in the order. (pasabay)

• Minimum of 10 pieces per brand. (min of 2 brands)

• The pickup of the products is at Medusa-PH shop. However, it still depends on the location, and it's possible to arrange a meetup if it's nearby. We also offer deliveries, but a delivery fee will apply.

• Please be advised that once the products are in your possession, you will be responsible for managing them, and you will have full control. This means we do not accept refunds and returns.

• Please be advised that the RSP (Retail Selling Price) may vary without prior notice (it might go up or down, but it's rare).

• There are 2 ways to acquire stocks:

Preorder: We can send you information about upcoming disposable products. This means you won't receive them immediately because they are on preorder. You can join in on this since we usually do preorders. You'll need to wait for the release date, and we'll keep you updated. We also require a 50% down payment (total of your preorders) for security purposes. Additionally, to support your business, we won't charge any markup. We'll only collect a transportation fee. Essentially, you'll be joining in on our order. You'll need to settle the remaining balance before we release the preordered products. Preorders also have a cutoff. This means you can't place orders once the cutoff is reached. So, after we provide the lineup of upcoming disposable products, we recommend that you place your order ASAP.

Onhand: If you need stocks immediately, we can request a list of their available items. Please be advised that it's possible that some flavors may not be complete, and stocks might be limited. We won't charge any markup here, only a transportation fee. In addition to this, once your orders are confirmed, you'll need to make the full payment before we can process the orders and acquire the stocks.

        <h2>Refund Policy</h1>
        <h4>
			<b><p>To ensure your satisfaction, ALL products must be tested in-store before leaving. If this process is skipped, we will not be able to offer a refund or replacement if defects arise.</p></b>
            <b><p>Customers are fully responsible for the care and maintenance of their vape products. We will not provide refunds or replacements for damage caused by misuse or improper handling.</p></b>
            
        </h4>

		<p>
			<b>When we can offer a refund OR replacement:</b>
		</p>
	    	<p>
			•If a defect is found during in-store testing (e.g., issues with charging, visible damages, inability to puff, malfunction, or any other VALID reason).
		</p>
	    	<p>
			•If a defect is reported within 5 days after purchase (testing must be done in-store at the time of purchase). Inspection will be required before issuing a refund or replacement.
		</p>
	    	<p>
			<b>When we cannot offer a refund OR replacement:</b>
		</p>
	    	<p>
			•If the item has a defect but was not tested in-store at the time of purchase. If the defect is due to flavor preferences or personal dislikes, including ALL e-juices.
		</p>
	    	<p>
			•If more than 5 days have passed since purchase, EVEN IF the item was tested in-store. For ALL online purchases (deliveries to ANY location), no refunds or replacements will be provided under any circumstances.
		</p>
		<p>
			Alternative Solutions: If the reason for a defect does not fall under the conditions outlined above, we may ONLY offer a gift card instead of a replacement or full refund. The gift card can be used at any time and has no expiration date, similar to a discount voucher.
